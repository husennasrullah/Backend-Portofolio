- **SQL**: Proficient in writing complex queries and working with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **NoSQL**: Familiarity with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis for handling non-relational data.

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Gin**: Expertise in building RESTful APIs with the Gin framework.
- **Asynq**: Experience in handling asynchronous tasks using the Asynq library.
- **GORM**: Proficient in using GORM for ORM in Golang projects.
- **Go Modules**: Strong understanding of Go modules for dependency management.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Docker**: Experience in containerizing applications using Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Familiarity with deploying and managing microservices in Kubernetes.
- **Git**: Proficient in version control using Git and platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- **CI/CD**: Knowledge of continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automating testing and deployment processes.

### Design & Architecture
- **Microservices**: Skilled in designing and implementing microservices architecture for scalable and maintainable applications.
- **API Design**: Expertise in designing RESTful APIs with clear and consistent endpoints.
- **Database Design**: Strong ability to design relational and non-relational database schemas that are efficient and scalable.
- **Error Handling**: Proficient in implementing comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure the reliability of applications.

### Others
- **Unit Testing**: Committed to writing unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Experience in profiling and optimizing code for better performance.
- **Documentation**: Strong emphasis on writing clear and concise documentation for both code and APIs.

## Projects

### [Project 1: XYZ API](https://github.com/yourusername/xyz-api)
A RESTful API built using Gin and GORM for managing XYZ data. The API supports full CRUD operations, with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

### [Project 2: Async Worker](https://github.com/yourusername/async-worker)
An asynchronous task processing system using Asynq, integrated with a SQL database for managing task queues and handling retries.

### [Project 3: Microservices Architecture](https://github.com/yourusername/microservices-architecture)
A collection of microservices built with Golang, each handling different aspects of a larger application. The services communicate via gRPC and are deployed on Kubernetes.
